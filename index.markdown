# <center>FAQ</center>

### WHAT IS HAT?

HAT is a tournament format where players register as individuals and teams are formed afterwards. It creates perfect opportunity to make new friends and play with players you have not played with before.

### WHEN?

December 16-17, from 9:00 on Saturday till around 14:00 on Sunday. Let us know below if you need a place to stay on Friday/Saturday night - we'll have a limited number of spots in a sleeping hall.

### WHERE?

<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TZL577dL1HTvbYUs7">Sports hall Slavomíra Šípoša, Alejová street 2, Košice</a>

Košice is best accessible with a car or via train/bus connection from the nearby major airports (Budapest 3.5h, Bratislava 4.5h, Vienna 6h, Prague 8.5h)

### HOW MUCH?

Thanks to the support of the City of Kosice, the player fee (PF) is only 30€. Includes 2-days of ultimate, Christmas Party, tournament dinner, sleeping in a gym, and more. PF is reduced by 5€ for beginners and juniors, and by a further 10€ if you opt-out from tournament dinner. 
  (IBAN: SK57 0900 0000 0005 7998 2153 in EUR or through <a href="https://revolut.me/mirosl21">Revolut</a> in whatever currency.)

### HOW?

We will play continuous 5v5 on hardcourt (handball court).

### WHAT SHOULD I BRING?

Indoor sports/running shoes, t-shirt in the colour of your team (you’ll find out your team later), water, Christmas spirit. Also, some extra layers as it might be fairly cold in the gym in the mornings.

### HAT COMPETITION ?!

Most importantly, there will be a <a class="animated_rainbow_1">Best Hat Competition</a>! So prepare your hats, caps, cylinders, wigs, turbans, helmets, sombreros, bandanas, kippahs.... What matters is impracticality, unusuality and unboringness. The prestigious Best Hat Award will be awarded to the bearer of the best hat.
